<h2>Description: It's a great chicken fry</h2>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
    <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room
        temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse
        paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the
        smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
    </li>
    <li>
        Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices
        run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees
        F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
    </li>
</ol>
